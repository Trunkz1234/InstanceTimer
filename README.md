# InstanceTimer

A simple Guild Wars mod that replaces the in-game clock with an instance timer.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- **GWCA Contributors** for their foundational work
- **Jon** for all of his incredible contributions to the project

## Installation

1. Keep `gwca.dll` and `InstanceTimer.dll` in the same folder
2. Inject `InstanceTimer.dll` using:
   - [GWLauncher](https://github.com/gwdevhub/gwlauncher) (recommended)
   - Any DLL injector of your choice

## Usage

**Important:** Make sure the in-game clock is active in your Guild Wars settings for the timer to display properly.

This mod does **nothing else** than display an instance timer - it's intentionally minimal and focused solely on timing functionality.

## Customization

You can customize the timer appearance using these chat commands:

- `/font small` - Small font (similar to the default in-game clock)
- `/font medium` - Medium font
- `/font large` - Large font

## What It Does

- Replaces the in-game clock display with an instance timer
- Shows time in HH:MM:SS.T format (hours:minutes:seconds.tenths)
- Tracks instance time

**That's it!** No other features, no interference with gameplay - just a clean, simple instance timer.
